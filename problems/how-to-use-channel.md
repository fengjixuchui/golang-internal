# How to use channel

Don't communicate by sharing memory, but share memory by communicating. 

In many good programming languages, the way multiple threads transfer data is generally shared memory. 

In order to solve thread competition, we need to limit the number of threads that can read and write these variables at the same time. 

However, this is not the same as the design encouraged by the Go language.

Although we can also use shared memory with mutex for communication in Go language, Go language provides a different concurrency model, namely Communicating sequential processes (CSP). Goroutine and Channel respectively correspond to the entity in CSP and the medium for transmitting information, and Goroutine will transmit data through Channel.



### runtime.hchan

Channel in Go language is represented by runtime.hchan structure at runtime. When we create a new Channel in Go language, what we actually create is the following structure:

```go
type hchan struct {
	qcount   uint           // total data in the queue
	dataqsiz uint           // size of the circular queue
	buf      unsafe.Pointer // points to an array of dataqsiz elements
	elemsize uint16
	closed   uint32
	elemtype *_type // element type
	sendx    uint   // send index
	recvx    uint   // receive index
	recvq    waitq  // list of recv waiters, read more in the type waitq
	sendq    waitq  // list of send waiters

	// lock protects all fields in hchan, as well as several
	// fields in sudogs blocked on this channel.
	//
	// Do not change another G's status while holding this lock
	// (in particular, do not ready a G), as this can deadlock
	// with stack shrinking.
	lock mutex
}

type waitq struct {
	first *sudog // read more in the type sudog
	last  *sudog
}

// sudog represents a g in a wait list, such as for sending/receiving
// on a channel.
//
// sudog is necessary because the g â†” synchronization object relation
// is many-to-many. A g can be on many wait lists, so there may be
// many sudogs for one g; and many gs may be waiting on the same
// synchronization object, so there may be many sudogs for one object.
//
// sudogs are allocated from a special pool. Use acquireSudog and
// releaseSudog to allocate and free them.
type sudog struct {
	// The following fields are protected by the hchan.lock of the
	// channel this sudog is blocking on. shrinkstack depends on
	// this for sudogs involved in channel ops.

	g *g

	next *sudog
	prev *sudog
	elem unsafe.Pointer // data element (may point to stack)

	// The following fields are never accessed concurrently.
	// For channels, waitlink is only accessed by g.
	// For semaphores, all fields (including the ones above)
	// are only accessed when holding a semaRoot lock.

	acquiretime int64
	releasetime int64
	ticket      uint32

	// isSelect indicates g is participating in a select, so
	// g.selectDone must be CAS'd to win the wake-up race.
	isSelect bool

	// success indicates whether communication over channel c
	// succeeded. It is true if the goroutine was awoken because a
	// value was delivered over channel c, and false if awoken
	// because c was closed.
	success bool

	parent   *sudog // semaRoot binary tree
	waitlink *sudog // g.waiting list or semaRoot
	waittail *sudog // semaRoot
	c        *hchan // channel
}
```


As we said before, All Channel creation in Go language will use the make keyword. The compiler will convert the make(chan int, 10) expression to a node of type OMAKE, and converts a node of type OMAKE to type OMAKECHAN during the type checking phase:

```go
// tcMake typechecks an OMAKE node.
func tcMake(n *ir.CallExpr) ir.Node {
  ...
	switch t.Kind() {
	default:
		base.Errorf("cannot make type %v", t)
		n.SetType(nil)
		return n

	...
	case types.TCHAN:
		l = nil
		if i < len(args) {
			l = args[i]
			i++
			l = Expr(l)
			l = DefaultLit(l, types.Types[types.TINT])
			if l.Type() == nil {
				n.SetType(nil)
				return n
			}
			if !checkmake(t, "buffer", &l) {
				n.SetType(nil)
				return n
			}
		} else {
			l = ir.NewInt(0)
		}
		nn = ir.NewMakeExpr(n.Pos(), ir.OMAKECHAN, l, nil) // change to op OMAKECHAN
	}

	...
}

// walkMakeChan walks an OMAKECHAN node.
func walkMakeChan(n *ir.MakeExpr, init *ir.Nodes) ir.Node {
	// When size fits into int, use makechan instead of
	// makechan64, which is faster and shorter on 32 bit platforms.
	size := n.Len
	fnname := "makechan64"
	argtype := types.Types[types.TINT64]

	// Type checking guarantees that TIDEAL size is positive and fits in an int.
	// The case of size overflow when converting TUINT or TUINTPTR to TINT
	// will be handled by the negative range checks in makechan during runtime.
	if size.Type().IsKind(types.TIDEAL) || size.Type().Size() <= types.Types[types.TUINT].Size() {
		fnname = "makechan"     // use makechan function
		argtype = types.Types[types.TINT]
	}

	return mkcall1(chanfn(fnname, 1, n.Type()), n.Type(), init, reflectdata.MakeChanRType(base.Pos, n), typecheck.Conv(size, argtype))
}
```

Finally, we can find the code for make a channel, we use hchan.

```go
func makechan(t *chantype, size int) *hchan {
   elem := t.elem

   ...

   // Hchan does not contain pointers interesting for GC when elements stored in buf do not contain pointers.
   // buf points into the same allocation, elemtype is persistent.
   // SudoG's are referenced from their owning thread so they can't be collected.
   // TODO(dvyukov,rlh): Rethink when collector can move allocated objects.
   var c *hchan
   switch {
   case mem == 0:
      // Queue or element size is zero.
      c = (*hchan)(mallocgc(hchanSize, nil, true))
      // Race detector uses this location for synchronization.
      c.buf = c.raceaddr()
   case elem.ptrdata == 0:
      // Elements do not contain pointers.
      // Allocate hchan and buf in one call.
      c = (*hchan)(mallocgc(hchanSize+mem, nil, true))
      c.buf = add(unsafe.Pointer(c), hchanSize)
   default:
      // Elements contain pointers.
      c = new(hchan)
      c.buf = mallocgc(mem, elem, true)
   }

   c.elemsize = uint16(elem.size)
   c.elemtype = elem
   c.dataqsiz = uint(size)
   ...
}
```
